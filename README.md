This project contains the code used to generate the explanatory math videos found on [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).  See also the community maintained version at [ManimCommunity](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/).

Note, while the library Manim itself is open source and under the MIT license, the contents of this project are intended only to be used for 3Blue1Brown videos themselves.
