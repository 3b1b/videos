            Needless to say, what I said here only scratches the 
            surface of the tip of the iceberg of the p-adic metric.  
            What is this new form of number I referred to?
            Why were distances in the 2-adic metric all powers of 
            $\\frac{1}{2}$ and not some other base?
            Why does it only work for prime numbers? \\\\
            \\quad \\\\
            I highly encourage anyone who has not seen p-adic numbers
            to look them up and learn more, but even more edifying than
            looking them up will be to explore this idea for yourself directly.
            What properties make a distance function useful, and why?
            What do I mean by ``useful''?  Useful for what purpose?
            Can you find infinite sums or sequences which feel like
            they should converge in the 2-adic metric, but don't converge 
            to a rational number? Go on!  Search!  Invent!
